# Monitoring and Consuming Events

The Casper platform uses [event streaming](../../operators/setup/node-events.md) to signal state changes in smart contracts and nodes. Using the [Casper Sidecar](#the-casper-sidecar) service and client-side SDKs, dApps actively listening for emitted events can consume them and perform actions based on event data.

Smart contracts can also emit contract-level events, as explained [here](../writing-onchain-code/emitting-contract-events.md). DApps can consume these events by listening to the event stream, detecting [TransactionProcessed](#deployprocessed) events, and parsing the `messages` array storing String-representations of the emitted events.

## The Casper Sidecar

The Casper Sidecar is an application running alongside the node process. It allows subscribers to monitor a node's event stream, query stored events, and query the node's JSON-RPC API, thus receiving faster responses and reducing the load placed on the node. The Sidecar supports the following functionalities:

* A [server-sent events (SSE) endpoint](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/blob/feat-2.0/README.md#the-sse-server) with an `/events` endpoint streaming events from all the connected nodes. The Sidecar also stores these events.
* A [REST API server](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/blob/feat-2.0/README.md#the-rest-api-server) that allows clients to query stored events.
* A [JSON-RPC API](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/blob/feat-2.0/README.md#the-rpc-api-server) to interact with a Casper node.
* [Legacy emulation](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/blob/feat-2.0/LEGACY_SSE_EMULATION.md) for clients using older versions of the SSE API.

## The Event Stream

Casper nodes offer an event stream API that returns server-sent events (SSEs) with JSON-encoded data. The Sidecar reads the event stream of all connected nodes, acting as a passthrough and replicating the SSE interface of the connected nodes.

The Sidecar can:
* Republish the current events from the node to clients listening to Sidecar's SSE API.
* Publish a configurable number of previous events to clients connecting to the Sidecar's SSE API with `?start_from=` query (similar to the node's SSE API).
* Store the events in external storage so clients can query them via the REST API.

The Sidecar also provides an endpoint for Sidecar-generated events that can be useful, although the node did not emit them. 

To summarize, events are divided into two categories and emitted on their respective endpoints:

- **Node-generated events** - All events coming from connected node(s) are emitted on the `events` endpoint. The default URL to consume these events on a Mainnet or Testnet node is usually `http://HOST:19999/events/`. This URL depends on how the Sidecar was configured on the node.
- **Sidecar-generated events** - The Sidecar also emits events on the `events/sidecar` endpoint, designated for events originating solely from the Sidecar service. The URL to consume these events using Sidecar on a Mainnet or Testnet node is usually `http://HOST:19999/events/sidecar/`. This URL depends on how the Sidecar was configured on the node.

The [Casper Sidecar Usage Guide](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/blob/feat-2.0/USAGE.md) describes each event type in detail.

### Listening to the Event Stream

Set up an event listener in your dApp using the following code to consume the event stream. The `NODE_ADDRESS` is the address of the node where the Sidecar was installed. The `PORT` is the address where the Sidecar streams events. It is `19999` by default, but you must find out how the Sidecar was configured.

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { EventStream, EventName } = require("casper-js-sdk")

const es = new EventStream("http://NODE_ADDRESS:PORT/events/")
es.start()
es.subscribe(EventName.EVENT_NAME, eventHandler)

const eventHandler = (event) => {
    console.log(event)
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from pycspr import NodeClient, NodeConnection, NodeEventType

def eventHandler(event):
    print(event)

client = NodeClient(NodeConnection(host = "NODE_ADDRESS", port_rpc = "PORT"))
client.get_events(eventHandler, NodeEventType.EVENT_NAME)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -s http://NODE_ADDRESS:PORT/events/
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can find node addresses of active online peers to replace `NODE_ADDRESS`, by navigating to [cspr.live](https://cspr.live/tools/peers) for Mainnet and [testnet.cspr.live](https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/peers) for Testnet.

Replace `EVENT_NAME` with one of the event types listed [below](#event-types).


### Detecting Contract-Level Events

The Sidecar streams messages emitted by a contract in a human-readable format. These messages are visible as part of the `TransactionProcessed` event after the corresponding block is processed and added to the blockchain. For more details, see [Verifying a Topic](../writing-onchain-code/emitting-contract-events.md#verifying-a-topic) and [Verifying a Message](../writing-onchain-code/emitting-contract-events.md#verifying-a-message).


### Reacting to Events

An application may parse each event needed for its use case and respond accordingly. Each event type contains additional data that might help decide whether to take action. For example, `TransactionAccepted` events contain the account's public key that submitted the transaction, the contract address, and more. This information can help determine how to proceed.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
const eventHandler = (event) => {
  if (event.body.TransactionAccepted.header.account == "012481699f9231e36ecf002675cd7186b48e6a735d10ec1b30f587ca716937752c") {
    // Perform an action
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
def eventHandler(event):
  if event["TransactionAccepted"]["header"]["account"] == "012481699f9231e36ecf002675cd7186b48e6a735d10ec1b30f587ca716937752c":
    # Perform an action
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Unsubscribing from Events

In many cases, an application may need to unsubscribe after a particular time or may want to unsubscribe from some events but not others. The Casper SDKs provide this ability with the `unsubscribe` function:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
es.unsubscribe(EventName.EVENT_NAME)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- `EVENT_NAME` - One of the different [event types](#event-types) emitted by a Casper node.

### Stopping the Event Stream

A dApp may cease listening to all events using the `stop` function:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
es.stop()
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Replaying the Sidecar Event Stream

This command will replay the event stream from an old event onward. Replace the `NODE_ADDRESS`, `PORT`, and `ID` fields with the values of your scenario.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -s http://NODE_ADDRESS:PORT/events?start_from=ID
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -sN http://65.21.235.219:19999/events?start_from=29267508
```

Note that certain shells like `zsh` may require an escape character before the question mark:

```bash
curl -sN http://65.21.235.219:19999/events?start_from=29267508
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The server will replay all the cached events if the ID is 0 or if you specify an event ID already purged from the cache.

## The JSON-RPC API

The Sidecar also offers a JSON-RPC API server for clients to interact with a Casper network. It is a JSON bridge between end users and a Casper node's binary port, forwarding requests to the Casper node's binary port. For more details on how the JSON-RPC API works, see the [JSON-RPC README](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/blob/feat-2.0/json_rpc/README.md).

## The REST API

The Sidecar offers a REST API to query stored events. You can discover the specific endpoints of the REST API using [OpenAPI](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/tree/feat-2.0?tab=readme-ov-file#openapi-specification) and [Swagger](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/tree/feat-2.0?tab=readme-ov-file#swagger-documentation). The [usage instructions](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar/blob/feat-2.0/USAGE.md) in the repository provide more details.
