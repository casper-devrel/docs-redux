# Transactions

Transactions are [a new structure](../developers/json-rpc/types_chain.md#transaction) that allows users to enact changes in global state on a Casper network. Introduced with the Condor release, Transactions supersede legacy [Deploys](./glossary/D.md#deploy), allowing for a variety of Wasm-less interactions with the blockchain. These new interactions are more efficient than Deploys and provide a level of convenience that was not previously available.

The existing Deploy model is deprecated as of Condor, and support will be removed entirely in a future major release. However, Condor will continue to accept valid Deploys and will attempt to execute them. Most existing deploys that function today will continue to do so. However, deploys that depend on a data type or FFI function that has been altered or removed will fail to execute.

## Transaction Types

The following is a list of Transaction types included within the [CLI Casper client](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/casper-client-rs/tree/dev) `put-transaction` or `put-txn` command.

### Withdraw Bid

`withdraw-bid` allows validators to withdraw their auction bid.

```json

casper-client put-txn withdraw-bid
/// The public key of the bidder.
  --public-key <FORMATTED STRING or PATH>
/// The amount in motes to be withdrawn.
  --transaction-amount <INTEGER>
/// The maximum gas price that the user is willing to pay for this transaction.
  --gas-price-tolerance <INTEGER>
/// The path to the local secret key file, or the [`initiator address`](../developers/json-rpc/types_chain.md#initiatoraddr) sending the transaction.

### Invocable Entity

`invocable-entity` allows a user to invoke an entry point on the given [`AddressableEntity`](./addressable-entity.md) directly using an [`Entity Address`](./key-types.md#addressableentity).
