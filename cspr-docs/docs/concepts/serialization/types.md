-   32-byte immutable contract identifier (called a "hash key")
-   32-byte reference identifier (called an "unforgeable reference")
-   32-byte transfer identifier
-   32-byte deploy information identifier
-   32-byte purse balance identifier
-   32-byte Auction bid identifier
-   32-byte Auction withdrawal identifier
-   32-byte Dictionary identifier
-   32-byte System Contract Registry
-   32-byte Auction unbond identifier
-   32-byte Chainspec Registry

The one exception to note here is the identifier for [`EraInfo`](#erainfo), which actually serializes as a [`u64`](./primitives.md#clvalue-numeric) value with an additional byte for the tag.

### Account Identity Key {#global-state-account-key}

This key type is used specifically for accounts in the global state. All accounts in the system must be stored under an account identity key, and no other types. The 32-byte identifier which represents this key is derived from the `blake2b256` hash of the public key used to create the associated account (see [Accounts](../design/casper-design.md#accounts-associated-keys-weights) for more information).

### Hash Key {#serialization-standard-hash-key}

This key type is used for storing contracts immutably. Once a contract is written under a hash key, that contract can never change. The 32-byte identifier representing this key is derived from the `blake2b256` hash of the deploy hash (see [block-structure-head](../design/casper-design.md#block-structure-head) for more information) concatenated with a 4-byte sequential ID. The ID begins at zero for each deploy and increments by one each time a contract is stored. The purpose of this ID is to allow each contract stored in the same deploy to have a unique key.

### Unforgeable Reference (`URef`) {#serialization-standard-uref}

`URef` broadly speaking can be used to store values and manage permissions to interact with the value stored under the `URef`. `URef` is a tuple which contains the address under which the values are stored and the Access rights to the `URef`. Refer to the [Unforgeable Reference](../design/casper-design.md#uref-head) section for details on how `URefs` are managed.

### Transfer Key {#serialization-standard-transfer-key}

This key type is used specifically for transfers in the global state. All transfers in the system must be stored under a transfer key and no other type. The 32-byte identifier representing this key is derived from the `blake2b256` hash of the transfer address associated with the given transfer.

### DeployInfo Key {#serialization-standard-deploy-info-key}

This key type is used specifically for storing information related to deploys in the global state. Information for a given deploy is stored under this key only. The 32-byte identifier which represents this key is derived from the `blake2b256` hash of the deploy itself.

### EraInfo Key {#serialization-standard-era-info-key}

This key type is used specifically for storing information related to the `Auction` metadata for a particular era. The underlying data type stored under this is a vector of the allocation of seigniorage for that given era. The identifier for this key is a new type that wraps around the primitive `u64` data type and co-relates to the era number when the auction information was stored.

This key type is used specifically for storing information related to auction bids in the global state. Information for the bids is stored under this key only. The 32-byte identifier which represents this key is derived from the `blake2b256` hash of the public key used to create the associated account (see [Accounts](../design/casper-design.md#accounts-associated-keys-weights) for more information).

This key type is used specifically for storing information related to auction withdraws in the global state. Information for the withdrawals is stored under this key only. The 32-byte identifier which represents this key is derived from the `blake2b256` hash of the public key used to create the associated account (see [Accounts](../design/casper-design.md#accounts-associated-keys-weights) for more information).

### Serialization for `Key` {#serialization-standard-serialization-key}

Given the different variants for the over-arching `Key` data-type, each of the different variants is serialized differently. This section of this chapter details how the individual variants are serialized. The leading byte of the serialized buffer acts as a tag indicating the serialized variant.

| `Key`        | Serialization Tag |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| `Account`    |  0               |
| `Hash`       |  1               |
| `URef`       |  2               |
| `Transfer`   |  3               |
| `DeployInfo` |  4               |
| `EraInfo`    |  5               |
| `Balance`    |  6               |
| `Bid`        |  7               |
| `Withdraw`   |  8               |
| `Dictionary` |  9               |
| `SystemContractRegistry`| 10    |
| `EraSummary` | 11               |
| `Unbond`     | 12               |
| `ChainspecRegistry` | 13        |
| `ChecksumRegistry` | 14         |
| `BidAddr`    | 15               |

| `Package`    | 16               |
| `AddressableEntity` | 17        |
| `ByteCode`   | 18               |
| `Message`    | 19               |

-   `Account` serializes as a 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the underlying `AccountHash`.
-   `Hash` serializes as a 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the underlying `Hash` itself.
-   `URef` is a tuple that contains the address of the URef and the access rights to that `URef`. The serialized representation of the `URef` is 33 bytes long. The first 32 bytes are the byte representation of the `URef` address, and the last byte contains the bits corresponding to the access rights of the `URef`. Refer to the [CLValue](./primitives.md#clvalue) section of this chapter for details on how `AccessRights` are serialized.
-   `Transfer` serializes as a 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the hash of the transfer.
-   `DeployInfo` serializes as 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the Deploy hash. See the Deploy section above for how Deploy hashes are serialized.
-   `EraInfo` serializes a `u64` primitive type containing the little-endian byte representation of `u64`.
-   `Balance` serializes as 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the URef address.
-   `Bid` and `Withdraw` both contain the `AccountHash` as their identifier; therefore, they serialize in the same manner as the `Account` variant.
-   `Dictionary` serializes as the 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the seed URef hashed with the identifying name of the dictionary item.
-   `SystemContractRegistry` serializes as a 32 byte long buffer of zeros.
-   `EraSummary` serializes as a 32 byte long buffer of zeros.
-   `Unbond` contains the `AccountHash` as its identifier; therefore, it serialize in the same manner as the `Account` variant.
-   `ChainspecRegistry` serializes as a 32 byte long buffer of ones.
-   `ChecksumRegistry` serializes as a 32 byte long buffer of zeros.
-   `BidAddr` may be one of three types:
    -   `Unified` serializes as the tag `0` followed by a 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of a legacy bid.
    -   `Validator` serializes as the tag `1` followed by a 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of a validator's hash.
    -   `Delegator` serializes as the tag `2` followed by a 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the associated validator's hash, appended with a 32 byte long buffer containing the byte representation of the given delegator's hash.

### Permissions {#serialization-standard-permissions}

There are three types of actions that can be done on a value: read, write, add. The reason for _add_ to be called out separately from _write_ is to allow for commutativity checking. The available actions depend on the key type and the context. Some key types only allow controlled access by smart contracts via the contract API, and other key types refer to values produced and used by the system itself and are not accessible to smart contracts at all but can be read via off-chain queries. This is summarized in the table below:

| Key      | Type Available Actions  |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Account  | Read + Add (via API)    |
| Hash     | Read                    |
| URef     | Read + Write and/or Add |
| Transfer | System                  |
| Deploy   | System                  |
| EraInfo  | System                  |
| Balance  | Read (via API)          |
| Bid      | System                  |
| Withdraw | System                  |
| Dictionary | Read (via API)        |
| SystemContractRegistry | Read (via API)|
| Unbond   | System                  |
| ChainspecRegistry | Read (via API) |

| 1 | Fixed | The cost of the transaction is determined by the cost table, per the transaction kind. |

### Classic {#pricingmode-classic}

After the `0` tag, a `Classic` `PricingMode` serializes as the [`u64`](./primitives.md#clvalue-numeric) `payment_amount` followed by the `u64` value of the `gas_price`.

### Fixed {#pricingmode-fixed}

## Stored Values {#serialization-standard-values}

A value stored in the global state is a `StoredValue`. A `StoredValue` is one of three possible variants:

-   A `CLValue`
-   A contract
-   An account

We discuss `CLValue` and contract in more detail below. Details about accounts can be found in [accounts-head](../design/casper-design.md#accounts-head).

Each `StoredValue` is serialized when written to the global state. The serialization format consists of a single byte tag, indicating which variant of `StoredValue` it is, followed by the serialization of that variant. The tag for each variant is as follows:

-   `CLValue` is `0`
-   `Account` is `1`
-   `Contract` is `2`

The details of `CLType` serialization are in the following section. Using the serialization format for `CLValue` as a basis, we can succinctly write the serialization rules for contracts and accounts:

-   contracts serialize in the same way as data with `CLType` equal to `Tuple3(List(U8), Map(String, Key), Tuple3(U32, U32, U32))`;
-   accounts serialize in the same way as data with `CLType` equal to `Tuple5(ByteArray(U8, 32), Map(String, Key), URef, Map(ByteArray(U8, 32), U8), Tuple2(U8, U8))`.

Note: `Tuple5` is not a presently supported `CLType`. However, it is clear how to generalize the rules for `Tuple1`, `Tuple2`, `Tuple3` to any size tuple.

## SystemContractRegistry {#systemcontractregistry}

SystemContractRegistry is a unique `Key` under which a mapping of the names and `ContractHashes` for system contracts. This includes `Mint`, `Auction`, `HandlePayment` and `StandardPayment`. It is serialized as a `BTreeMap` where the first 4 bytes represent a `u32` value describing the number of names as strings and [ContractHashes](./structures.md#contracthash) held within. The remainder consists of a repeating pattern of serialized strings and then ContractHashes of the length dictated by the first four bytes.

| 1 | `Auction` |
| 2 | `StandardPayment` |
| 3 | `HandlePayment` |
