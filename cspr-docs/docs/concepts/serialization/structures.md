# Major Structures

## Account {#serialization-standard-account}

An Account is a structure that represented a user on a legacy Casper network. Alongside the Condor protocol release, `Accounts` were replaced with `AddressableEntities` of the type `Account`. The account structure consists of the following fields:

-   [`account_hash`](./types.md#account-hash)

-   [`named_keys`](./types.md#namedkey)

-   `main_purse`: The account's main purse `URef`. You may find information on `URef` serialization [here](./primitives.md#clvalue-uref).

-   [`associated_keys`](./types.md#associatedkey)

-   [`action_thresholds`](./types.md#account-action-thresholds)

## AddressableEntity {#addressable-entity}

An Addressable Entity is a structure that represents an entity on a Casper network. The addressable entity consists of the following fields:

- [`package_hash`](./types.md#packagehash)

- [`byte_code_hash`](./types.md#byte-code-hash)

- [`entry_points`](./types.md#entrypoints)

- [`protocol_version`](./types.md#protocolversion)

- `main_purse`: The entity's main purse `URef`. You may find information on `URef` serialization [here](./primitives.md#clvalue-uref).

- [`associated_keys`](./types.md#associatedkey)

- [`action_thresholds`](./types.md#entity-action-thresholds)

- [`message_topics`](./types.md#message-topics)

- [`entity_kind`](./types.md#entity-kind)

## Block {#serialization-standard-block}

A block is the core component of the Casper linear blockchain, used in two contexts:

1.  A data structure containing a collection of transactions. Blocks form the primary structure of the blockchain.
2.  A message that is exchanged between nodes containing the data structure as explained in (1).

Each block has a globally unique ID, achieved by hashing the contents of the block.

Each block points to its parent. An exception is the first block, which has no parent.

A block is structurally defined as follows:

-   `hash`: A hash over the header of the block.
-   `header`: The header of the block that contains information about the contents of the block with additional metadata.
-   `body`: The block's body contains the proposer of the block and hashes of deploys and transfers contained within it.

Further, a block may consist of one of the following types:

- `Version1`: A legacy block created prior to the Condor upgrade.

- `Version2`: A modern block.

### BlockHash {#block-hash}

The block hash is a `Digest` over the contents of the block Header. The `BlockHash` serializes as the byte representation of the hash itself.

### BlockHeader {#block-header}

The header portion of a block, structurally, is defined as follows:

-   `parent_hash` is the hash of the parent block. It serializes to the byte representation of the parent hash. The serialized buffer of the `parent_hash` is 32 bytes long.
-   `state_root_hash` is the global state root hash produced by executing this block's body. It serializes to the byte representation of the `state root hash`. The serialized buffer of the `state_root_hash` is 32 bytes long.
-   `body_hash` the hash of the block body. It serializes to the byte representation of the body hash. The serialized buffer of the `body_hash` is 32 bytes long.
-   `random_bit` is a boolean needed for initializing a future era. It is serialized as a single byte; true maps to 1, while false maps to 0.
-   `accumulated_seed` is a seed needed for initializing a future era. It serializes to the byte representation of the parent Hash. The serialized buffer of the `accumulated_hash` is 32 bytes long.
-   `era_end` contains equivocation and reward information to be included in the terminal finalized block. It is an optional field. Thus if the field is set as `None`, it serializes to _0_. The serialization of the other case is described in the EraEnd.
-   `timestamp` The timestamp from when the block was proposed. It serializes as a single `u64` value. The serialization of a `u64` value is described in the CLValues section.
-   `era_id` Era ID in which this block was created. It serializes as a single `u64` value.
-   `height` The height of this block, i.e., the number of ancestors. It serializes as a single `u64` value.
-   `protocol_version` The version of the Casper network when this block was proposed. It is 3-element tuple containing `u32` values. It serializes as a buffer containing the three `u32` serialized values. Refer to the CLValues section on how `u32` values are serialized.

Both `BlockHeaderV1` and `BlockHeaderV2` serialize in the same way.

### EraEndV1 {#eraendV1}

`EraEndV1` as represented within the block header, is a struct containing two fields.

-   `era_report`: The first field is termed as `EraReport` and contains information about equivocators and rewards for an era.
-   `next_era_validator_weights`: The second field is map for the validators and their weights for the era to follow.

`EraReport` itself contains two fields:

-   `equivocators`: A vector of `PublicKey`.
-   `rewards`: A Binary Tree Map of `PublicKey` and `u64`.
-   `inactive_validators`: A vector of `PublicKey`.

When serializing an EraReport, the buffer is first filled with the individual serialization of the PublicKey contained within the vector.

-   If the `PublicKey` is an `Ed25519` key, the first byte within the buffer is a `1` followed by the individual bytes of the serialized key.
-   If the `PublicKey` is an `Secp256k1` key, the first byte within the buffer is a `2` followed by the individual bytes of the serialized key.

When serializing the overarching struct of `EraEndV1`, we first allocate a buffer, which contains the serialized representation of the `EraReport` as described above, followed by the serialized BTreeMap.

Note that `EraEndV1` is an optional field. Thus the above scheme only applies if there is an `EraEndV1`; if there is no era end, the field simply serializes to _0_.

### EraEndV2 {#eraendV2}

`EraEndV1` as represented within the block header, is a struct containing four fields.

- `equivocators`: A vector of `PublicKey` listing equivocators for the era.
- `inactive_validators`: A list of inactive validators for the era.
- `next_era_validator_weights`: A map of validators and their weights for the era to follow.
- `rewards`: A Binary Tree Map of `PublicKey` and `u64`.
- `next_era_gas_price`: The next era's gas price as a `u8`.

Note that `EraEndV2` is an optional field. Thus the above scheme only applies if there is an `EraEndV2`; if there is no era end, the field simply serializes to _0_.

### BlockBodyV1 {#blockbodyV1}

The body portion of a block, prior to the Condor upgrade, is structurally defined as:

-   `proposer`: The PublicKey which proposed this block.
-   `deploy_hashes`: Is a vector of hex-encoded hashes identifying Deploys included in this block.
-   `transfer_hashes`: Is a vector of hex-encoded hashes identifying Transfers included in this block.

When we serialize the `BlockBodyV1`, we create a buffer that contains the serialized representations of the individual fields present within the block.

-   `proposer` serializes to the byte representation of the `PublicKey`. If the `PublicKey` is an `Ed25519` key, then the first byte within the serialized buffer is 1 followed by the bytes of the key itself; else, in the case of `Secp256k1`, the first byte is 2.
-   `deploy_hashes` serializes to the byte representation of all the deploy_hashes within the block header. Its length is `32 * n`, where n denotes the number of deploy hashes present within the body.
-   `transfer_hashes` serializes to the byte representation of all the deploy_hashes within the block header. Its length is `32 * n`, where n denotes the number of transfers present within the body.

### BlockBodyV2 {blockbodyv2}

A modern block is structurally defined as:

-   [`transactions`](#transaction): Is a `BTreeMap` of transaction hashes and their given categories. It is serialized as a `BTreeMap` where the first 4 bytes represent a `u32` value describing the number of values held within. The remainder consists of a repeating pattern of transaction categories as a `u8` value and then the associated `TransactionHash` the category tag describes.

-   [`rewarded_signatures`](./types.md#rewarded-signatures): A list of identifiers for finality signatures for a particular past block. It serializes as a vector of `SingleBlockRewardedSignatures` which describes signatures for a single ancestor block. The first entry represents the signatures for the parent block, the second for the parent of the parent, and so on.
