# Essential Rust Crates

Several Rust crates are available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) to support smart contract development with Rust. A crate is a compilation unit that can be compiled into a binary or a library. The corresponding documentation is published on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs). The most important crates are listed below.

## `casper-types`

Types shared by many Casper crates:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-types
- https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest

## `casper-contract`

A library for developing Casper smart contracts:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-contract
- https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest

## `casper-engine-test-support`

The Casper test support library:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-engine-test-support
- https://docs.rs/casper-engine-test-support/

## `casper-node`

The component for running a node on a Casper network:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-node
- https://docs.rs/casper-node/latest

## `casper-client`
A client library for interacting with a Casper network:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-client
- https://docs.rs/casper-client/latest

## `casper-event-standard`

A Rust library that provides a simple and standardized way for Casper contracts to emit events:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-event-standard
- https://docs.rs/casper-event-standard/latest

## `casper-hashing`

A library providing hashing functionality including Merkle Proof utilities:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-hashing
- https://docs.rs/casper-hashing/latest/

## `casper-wasm-utils`

Command-line utilities and corresponding Rust API for producing pwasm-compatible executables:
- https://crates.io/crates/casper-wasm-utils
- https://docs.rs/casper-wasm-utils/latest

## `cargo-casper`

A command line tool for creating a Wasm smart contract and tests:
- https://crates.io/crates/cargo-casper
- https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-casper/latest
