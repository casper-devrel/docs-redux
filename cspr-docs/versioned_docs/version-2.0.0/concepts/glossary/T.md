## Token {#token}

A type of cryptocurrency that represents an asset. See [CSPR](./C.md#cspr).

## Transaction {#transaction}

Transactions are a unit of work sent by a client to the network, which when executed can cause global state to be altered. They were introduced with Casper's Condor release and supersede the concept of a [Deploy](./D.md#deploy). Transactions offer more efficient means of interacting with a Casper network, but legacy deploys will continue to function, in most cases. More information on transactions can be found [here](../transactions.md).


## Turing-complete blockchain {#turing-complete-blockchain}

Turing completeness refers to the ability of a machine to execute computational problems on its own by deciding or recognizing data manipulation rule sets.

For a blockchain to be Turing-complete, it means that it can understand and execute any smart contract given enough resources such as a robust code-base (necessary instructions), time, processing power, memory, etc. without human interaction or interference.
